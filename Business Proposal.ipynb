Therefore, the city has experienced a strong migration movement for the past few years. This project will help newcomers decide among the nine main parishes of Porto (2), which is the most appropriate for them based on ease of access to shops, theaters, schools, health care services, etc. \n",

With this in mind, we will perform a cluster analysis to group the parishes of Porto according to the characteristics of their venues (e.g., shop, schools, supermarkets), which will help newcomers to decide which is the best type of parish for them, based on the most frequent type of venues in each parish."
